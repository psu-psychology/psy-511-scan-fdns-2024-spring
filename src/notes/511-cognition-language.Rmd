## Sparked by behavioral imperatives?  [[@fox_what_2016]](http://doi.org/10.1038/530268a)

- Behavior requires energy
- Behavior requires perception at a distance
- Behavior requires action
- Actions require
    - Problem solving, (sequence) planning
    - Current + stored information (memory)

### Behaviors realized through...

- Perception at a distance of what/where
- Locomotion
    - Approach/avoid/explore
- Object manipulation/consumption
- Signaling/communication
- Physiological regulation

> *The results of our multimodal analysis revealed that the neural activity required for the execution of cognitive tasks corresponds to flow within a low-dimensional state space43. Across multiple, diverse cognitive tasks, the dynamics of large-scale brain activity engage an integrative core of brain regions that maximizes information-processing complexity and facilitates cognitive performance; only to then dissipate as the tasks conclude, flowing towards a more segregated architecture...Across multiple cognitive tasks with markedly different behavioral requirements, the dynamics of human brain activity were found to occupy a low-dimensional state space embedding that may form the functional backbone of cognition in the human brain.*
