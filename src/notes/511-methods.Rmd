### Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

#### What it measures/how it works

- Magnetic resonance a property of some isotopes and complex molecules
- Hydrogen ($H$), common in water & fat, is one
- In magnetic field, $H$ atoms absorb and release radio frequency (RF) energy
- $H$ atoms align with strong magnetic field

---

- Applying RF pulse perturbs alignment
- Rate/timing of realignment varies by tissue
- Realignment gives off radio frequency (RF) signals
- Strength of RF ~ density of $H$ (or other target)
- K-space (frequency/phase) -> anatomical space
    - [Fourier analysis and synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) important for psychological/neural science, but possibly unfamiliar to many.

> Top panel: (a) voxel-based morphometry (VBM) findings. Regions showing significant volume reduction thresholded at P=0.01 in the schizophrenic patients are shown in orange. Bottom panel: (b) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings. Regions are shown where there were significant differences between patients and controls during performance of the n-back task (2-back vs baseline comparison), thresholded at P=0.01. Blue indicates hypoactivation, that is, areas where controls activated significantly more than the patients. Orange indicates areas where the schizophrenic patients showed failure to deactivate in comparison to controls. The right side of the images represents the left side of the brain.

- Volume differences in schizophrenics vs. controls
- Colored portions are statistical maps placed on top of a base structural map.
- Maps (a) provide information about the comparison in brain volumes between patients and controls in those areas, and in (b) functional imaging differences in an n-back task.

>Grid electrodes: (A) Craniotomy performed for electrocorticography (ECoG) grid electrode placement in epilepsy surgery candidate at Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, Florida Hospital for Children, Orlando, Florida, United States. (B) ECoG electrode grids placed directly on the brain surface. They will be used during presurgical monitoring for localizing seizure onset zone. The same electrodes are stimulated during electrical cortical stimulation mapping for identification of eloquent cortex. The ECoG signal recorded from these grids is separated in a different stream and used for real-time functional mapping (RTFM). (C) 3D reconstruction of the brain with overlaid grid electrodes. This reconstruction is used for creating RTFM montage.

- Radioactive tracers (glucose, oxygen)
- Positron decay activates paired detectors
- Tomographic techniques reconstruct 3D geometry
- Experimental condition - control
- Average across individuals
- Temporal (~ s) and spatial (mm-cm) resolution worse than fMRI
- Radioactive exposures + mildly invasive

> Our main finding was that higher DEBQ scores were associated with lower central availability of MORs and CB1Rs in healthy, nonobese humans. MOR and CB1R systems however showed distinct patterns of associations with specific dimensions of self-reported eating: While CB1Rs were associated in general negatively with different DEBQ subscale scores (and most saliently with the Total DEBQ score), MORs were specifically and negatively associated with externally driven eating only. Our results support the view that variation in endogenous opioid and endocannabinoid systems explain interindividual variation in feeding, with distinct effects on eating behavior measured with DEBQ.

> Fig. 2. Task-specific changes during finger tapping and visual stimulation obtained with fPET and fMRI across all subjects. Good agreement between CMRGlu and BOLD was observed for primary motor and visual cortices. However, in secondary areas (e.g., supplementary motor area, cerebellum, secondary visual areas) significant changes were only detected with fMRI but not with fPET (Table 2). Statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons at p<0.05 FWE corrected voxel-level.

> The brain's energy budget can be non-invasively assessed with different imaging modalities such as functional MRI (fMRI) and PET (fPET), which are sensitive to oxygen and glucose demands, respectively. The introduction of hybrid PET/MRI systems further enables the simultaneous acquisition of these parameters...The absence of a correlation and the different activation pattern between fPET and fMRI suggest that glucose metabolism and oxygen demand capture complementary aspects of energy demands.

## Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)

- Neural activity -> local $O_2$ consumption increase
- *Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD)* response
- Oxygenated vs. deoxygenated hemoglobin ≠ magnetic susceptibility
- How do regional blood $O_2$ levels (& flow & volume) vary with behavior X?
- MRI "signals" relate to the speed (1/T) of "relaxation" of the perturbed nuclei to their state of alignment with the main ($B_0$) magnetic field.
- Imaging protocols emphasize different time constants of this relaxation ($T1$, $T2$, $T2^*$); $T^{2^*}$ for BOLD imaging

### Evaluating fMRI

- Non-invasive, but expensive
- Moderate but improving (mm) spatial, temporal (~sec) resolution
- Spatial limits due to 
    - field strength (@ 3T $~3mm^3$ voxel)
    - Physiology of hemodynamic response
- Temporal limits due to
    - Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF): ~ 1s delay plus 3-6 s ramp-up
    - Speed of image acquisition
- *Indirect* measure of neural activity

### Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF) {.smaller}

- Solutions
    - Make data, materials (analysis code) more widely and openly available
    - [OpenNeuro.org](https://openneuro.org), [Human Connectome Project](https://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/), [Databrary.org](https://databrary.org), etc.
    - Reuse shared data (e.g., [Adolescent Brain & Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study](https://abcdstudy.org/))
    - Increase sample sizes, improve detection of small effects

### Functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)

- Near infrared light penetrates scalp and skull, refracted by brain tissue
- Returned signal altered by blood $O_2$ levels
- Time course (temporal resolution) ~ BOLD fMRI
- Spatial resolution low
- More suitable for pediatric populations (less susceptible to movement artefact)

#### Evaluating EEG

- High temporal, poor spatial resolution
- Analyze activity in different 'bands' of frequencies (via [Fourier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) analysis)
    + LOW: deep sleep (delta or $\delta$ band)
    + MIDDLE: Quiet, alert state (alpha $\alpha$ band)
    + HIGHER: Sensorimotor activity reflecting observed actions? (mu or $\mu$ band), [[@Hobson2017-oj]](https://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.160662)
    + HIGHER STILL: “Binding” information across senses or plasticity? (gamma or $\gamma$ band), [[@Amo2017-tz]](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186008)

### Magneto-encephalography (MEG)

- Like EEG, but measuring magnetic fields
- Electrical and magnetic fields orthogonal
- High temporal resolution
- Magnetic fields propagate w/o distortion
    - But are orthogonal to electric field

knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Onde_electromagnetique.svg/220px-Onde_electromagnetique.svg.png")
```
    
- Requires shielded chamber (to keep out strong magnetic fields)
- ++ cost vs. EEG

- BOLD fMRI likely reflects **presynaptic** *input* to area
- EEG/MEG likely reflects **postsynaptic** *response* to those inputs

#### Evaluating neuropsychological methods

- Logic: IF damage to area X impairs performance, THEN region critical for behavior Y
- *Double dissociation*: Damage to area Z leaves behavior Y intact 
- Weak spatial/temporal resolution

## Stimulating the brain

- Electrical (**Direct Current Stimulation - DCS**)
- Pharmacological
- Magnetic (**Transcranial magnetic stimulation - TMS**)
- Spatial/temporal resolution?
- Assume stimulation mimics natural activity?

#### Deep brain stimulation as therapy

- Depression 
- Epilepsy
- Parkinson’s Disease

### Human brain organoids

> Brain organoids represent a powerful tool for studying human neurological diseases, particularly those that affect brain growth and structure. However, many diseases manifest with clear evidence of physiological and network abnormality in the absence of anatomical changes, raising the question of whether organoids possess sufficient neural network complexity to model these conditions. Here, we explore the network-level functions of brain organoids using calcium sensor imaging and extracellular recording approaches that together reveal the existence of complex network dynamics reminiscent of intact brain preparations. We demonstrate highly abnormal and epileptiform-like activity in organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from individuals with Rett syndrome, accompanied by transcriptomic differences revealed by single-cell analyses. We also rescue key physiological activities with an unconventional neuroregulatory drug, pifithrin-α. Together, these findings provide an essential foundation for the utilization of brain organoids to study intact and disordered human brain network formation and illustrate their utility in therapeutic discovery.

Plots display the full distribution of individual data points. Dashed and dotted lines indicate the median and quartile values, respectively. n = 3 independent experiments for Cx + Cx and Cx + GE. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) P = 0.0011, F = 8.301, d.f. (between columns) = 3 followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparison test; **P = 0.0028 for Cx + Cx versus Cx + GE BMI; **P = 0.0100 for Cx + Cx BMI versus Cx + GE BMI; **P = 0.0031 for Cx + GE versus Cx + GE BMI. f–h, LFPs measured from a representative Cx + GE fusion revealed robust oscillatory activities at multiple frequencies during a 5-min period, reflected in both raw traces (f) and the spectrogram (g). Spectral density analysis in h demonstrates the presence of multiple distinct oscillatory peaks ranging from ~1–100 Hz. i–k, Cx + Cx fusion organoids by contrast lack measurable oscillatory activities. Representative traces in f–h are taken from three independent experiments and in i–k from four independent experiments. NS, not significant.
