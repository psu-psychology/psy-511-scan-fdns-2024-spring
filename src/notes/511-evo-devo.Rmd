# Evolution

## Public acceptance of evolution

### Types of evidence

- Fossil
    + Fossil dating
- Geological
    + Where fossils are found relative to one another
    + How long it takes to form layers
- Genetic
    + Rates of mutation
- Anatomical
    + Homologous structures across species

> **Nothing in Biology Makes Sense except in the Light of Evolution**
>
> *"Seen in the light of evolution, biology is, perhaps, intellectually the most satisfying and inspiring science. Without that light, it becomes a pile of sundry facts some of them interesting or curious, but making no meaningful picture as a whole."*

[[@Dobzhansky1973]](http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4444260)

### Why Gilmore thinks the theory so controversial (in the U.S.)

- Contradicts verbatim/non-metaphorical reading of some religious texts
- Makes humans seem less special
- Time scales involved beyond human experience
- Scientific method vs. other ways of knowing
- Found in nature ≠ good for human society
- Few negative consequences of 'disbelief'
- U.S. culture individualistic, skeptical, anti-elitist, anti-intellectual
- Lower levels of religious belief among [U.S. scientists](http://news.rice.edu/2015/12/03/first-worldwide-survey-of-religion-and-science-no-not-all-scientists-are-atheists/)
- [Politics](http://www.people-press.org/2009/07/09/section-4-scientists-politics-and-religion/)
- A minority of citizens support teaching [evolution-only](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/education/2015/12/evolutionschools/) 
- Majority of classroom teachers aren't [strong advocates](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110127141657.htm)

> A structural equation model indicates that increasing enrollment in baccalaureate-level programs, exposure to college-level science courses, a declining level of religious fundamentalism, and a rising level of civic scientific literacy are responsible for the increased level of public acceptance.

## Evolution and development

### Ontogenesis and phylogenesis

- *Ontogenesis*
    + Development within lifetimes, history of individuals
- *Phylogenesis*
    + Change across lifestimes, history of species

#### Ontogeny does not recapitulate phylogeny ([Haeckel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Haeckel)), but...

### Nervous system architectures

#### How nervous systems differ

- Body symmetry
    + radial
    + bilateral

**An animal with a nerve "net"**

<iframe width="600" height="800" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-UI531GMRTM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- Segmentation
- Cephalization (concentration of sensory & neural structures in anterior portion of body)
- Encasement in bone (vertebrates)
- Centralized vs. distributed function

**Cephalopods have "intelligent arms"**

### The essentials of biological computation

- Ingestion
- Defense
- Reproduction

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/swanson-fig-7.5.jpg")
```

#### Information processing universals

- Sense/detect via sensors
  - Specialize by information source/type
  - Specialize by target location
    + Interoceptive
    + Exteroceptive
- Analyze, evaluate, decide
  - Current state
      + World
      + Organism
  - Current goals
  - Past state(s)
- Act
    + Move body
      - Approach/avoid
      - Manipulate
      - Ingest
      - Signal
    - Change physiological state

> Figure 2: Comparison of neurodevelopment in the frog, annelid and sea anemone. The frog Xenopus laevis (part a), the annelid Platynereis dumerilii (part b) and the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis (part c) are depicted in their gastrula-like stages (gastrula, trochophora and planula, respectively; upper panels), intermediate developmental (neurula, metatrochophora and late planula, respectively; middle panels) and juvenile stages (tadpole, nectochaete and polyp, respectively; lower panels). Colours demarcate developmental neurogenic regions, and double-headed arrows show the apical (AP)–blastoporal (BL) axis. All views in parts a–c are lateral. At gastrula stages (upper panels), blastoporal ectodermal tissue (around the closing blastopore; red) and apical pole ectodermal tissue (violet) can be distinguished. At subsequent stages, a large part of the ectoderm — incluing the former apical and blastoporal regions — gives rise to neurogenic tissue. The neurogenic tissue comprises regions of distinct molecular identity (indicated by different colours), which will give rise to different parts of the nervous system. In the frog (part a), the neural plate (violet, red and yellow) comprises future forebrain tissue, as well as medial and lateral neural tube tissue; it is laterally bounded by developing peripheral nervous system components (blue). Similar regions are apparent in the annelid (part b), and these give rise to the brain, medial and lateral nerve cord and peripheral nervous system. As reasoned in this article, these regions also exist in the cnidarian (part c). In the frog and annelid worm, these regions are further subdivided into specific subregions by the activity of molecular organizing signals15.

<smaller>Figure 1. Lateral views of the brains of some mammals to show the evolutionary development of the neocortex (gray). In the hedgehog almost the entire neocortex is occupied by sensory and motor areas. In the prosimian Galago the sensory cortical areas are separated by an area occupied by association cortex (AS). A second area of association cortex is found in front of the motor cortex. In man these anterior and posterior association areas are strongly developed. A, primary auditory cortex; AS, association cortex; Ent, entorhinal cortex; I, insula; M, primary motor cortex; PF, prefrontal cortex; PM, premotor cortex; S, primary somatosensory cortex; V, primary visual cortex.

| Cortical gray + white | mice 40% | 80% |
| Cerebellar mass | primates, mammals 10-15% | 10-15% |

**Take homes**

- Brain sizes scale with body size
- Brain sizes (more or less) scale with animal class (more or less)

**Old story**

- Within mammals, human brains bigger than expected
    - Higher *encephalization quotient* -- deviation from species-typical norm
    
```{r, fig.cap="[[@Northcutt2002-jg]](http://doi.org/10.1093/icb/42.4.743)"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/northcutt-2002-f2.gif")
```

- Humans have larger cerebral cortical gray + white matter than comparable mammals

**vs. New story**

- Does brain size/mass matter (that much)?
- "Size matters" (brain mass) presumes similarity among brains at micro-level
- Big (large mass) brains arise in multiple mammalian lineages

```{r, fig.cap="[[@Herculano-Houzel2012-up]](http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1201895109)"}

```

- *# of cortical neurons* more important difference than brain mass
- The primate advantage -> more cortical neurons, but not larger neurons & not more neurons in cerebellum
- Human brain just scaled up (non-ape) primate brain

**The Human Advantage [@Herculano-Houzel2016-oy]**

- Brain
    - More neurons in cerebral cortex than other mammals
- Behavior
    - Less time spent foraging
        + Higher quality/more energetically dense food
        + Higher food availability
    - Cultural factors (agriculture + cooking), see also [@Wrangham2009-vq]

>
> [[@Silbereis2016-la]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2015.12.008)

- CNS among earliest-developing, last to finish organ systems
    - Prolonged developmental period makes CNS especially vulnerable
- ~ 86 billion neurons in adult CNS
    - similar # of glia
    - about 16 (14-32) billion neurons, 80/20% Glu/GABA
    - 7-80K synapses/cortical neuron
    - 164 trillion synapses in cerebral cortex, [[@DeFelipe2002-xz]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1024130211265)
    - $10^{15}$ (quadrillion) synapses in CNS
    - 145-175 km (90-109 mi) of myelinated axons, [[@Marner2003-qu]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cne.10714)
    - brain ~ 2.5% of body mass, but consumes 18% of $O_2$ at rest, [[@Kety1948-ty]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1172/JCI101994), and has been estimated to consume about 20 W.
    - millions of neurons generated per hour
    
## Prenatal period

### Summary

- 38 weeks from conception/fertilization on average
- Embryonic period (weeks 1-8), fetal period (weeks 9-)
- 3 12-13 week trimesters

### Insemination

- Can occur 3-4 days before or up to 1-2 days after...
    + Ovulation

### Fertilization

- Within ~ 24 hrs of ovulation

### Implantation

- ~ 6 days after fertilization

### Early embryogenesis

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dAOWQC-OBv0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Formation of *neural tube* (neurulation)

```{r}

```

- Embryonic layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm
    - Neural tube forms ~ 23 pcd (postconceptual days)
- Neural tube closes in middle, moves toward rostral & caudal ends, closing by 29 - 30 pcd.
- Failures of neural tube closure
    + Anencephaly (rostral neuraxis)
    + Spina bifida (caudal neuraxis)

- Rostro-caudal patterning via differential growth into vesicles
    - Forebrain (prosencephalon)
    - Midbrain (mesencephalone)
    - Hindbrain (rhomencephalon)

### Neurogenesis and gliogenesis

- Neuroepithelium cell layer lines neural tube creating ventricular zone (VZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ)
    - Peri-ventricular regions home to pluripotent stem and progenitor cells that produce new neurons & glia
- Neurogenesis (of excitatory Glu neurons) observed by 27 pcd (7 pcw; post-conceptual week)
    - complete by 191 pcd (27 pcw), [[@Silbereis2016-la]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2015.12.008)
- Most cortical and striatal neurons generated prenatally, but
    - Cerebellum continues to ~ 18 mos

> a, Comparison between DCX expression in HIP and the density of DCX-immunopositive cells in the human dentate gyrus36. b, Comparison between transcriptome-based dendrite development trajectory in DFC and Golgi-method-based growth of basal dendrites of layer 3 (L3) and 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons in the human DFC41. c, Comparison between transcriptome-based synapse development trajectory in DFC and density of DFC synapses calculated using electron microscopy42. For b and c, PC1 for gene expression was plotted against age to represent the developmental trajectory of genes associated with dendrite (b) or synapse (c) development. Independent data sets were centred, scaled and plotted on a logarithmic scale. d, PC1 value for the indicated sets of genes (expressed as percentage of maximum) plotted against age to represent general trends and regional differences in several neurodevelopmental processes in NCX, HIP and CBC.

## Summary of developmental milestones

### Prenatal

+ Neuro- and gliogenesis
+ Migration
+ Synaptogenesis begins
+ Differentiation
+ Apoptosis
+ Myelination begins
+ Infant gene expression ≠ Adult

### Postnatal

+ Synaptogenesis
+ Cortical expansion, activity-dependent change
- Then cubic, quadratic, or linear declines in cortical thickness
+ Myelination
+ Connectivity changes (esp within networks)
+ Prolonged period of postnatal/pre-reproductive development [[@konner_evolution_2011]](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674062016)

> Figure 3: Three accounts of the neural basis of an advance in behavioural abilities in infants.
> a | A maturational view in which the neuroanatomical maturation of one region, in this case the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPC), allows new behavioural abilities to emerge. Specifically, maturation of DLPC has been associated with successful performance in the object retrieval task (Fig. 1a)50. Note that although the task itself involves activity in several regions, it is thought to be maturation of only one of these, the DLPC, that results in changed behaviour. b | An interactive specialization view in which the onset of a new behavioural ability is due to changes in the interactions between several regions that were already partially active. In this hypothetical illustration, it is suggested that changes in the interactions between DLPC, parietal cortex and cerebellum might give rise to successful performance in the object retrieval paradigm. In contrast to the maturational view, it is refinement of the connectivity between regions, rather than within a single region, that is important. According to this view, regions adjust their functionality together to allow new computations. c | A skill-learning model, in which the pattern of activation of cortical regions changes during the acquisition of new skills throughout the lifespan. In the example illustrated there is decreasing activation of DLPC and medial frontal cortex (pre-supplementary motor area), accompanied by increasing activation of more posterior regions (such as intraparietal sulcus), as human adults perform a visuomotor sequence learning task77. It is suggested that similar changes might occur during the acquisition of new skills by infants. These three accounts are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
