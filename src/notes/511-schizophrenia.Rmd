<!-- Symptom profiles of different types of psychosis -->

## Biological bases

- Genetic predisposition
- Brain abnormalities
- Neurochemical factors
- Developmental origins

### Genetic predisposition

<div class="centered">
<img src="img/schizophrenia-risk.jpg" height=450px>
</div>

- Heritability 80%
- vs. 60% for osteoarthritis
- 30-50% for hypertension

<small>
[[@Van_Os2009-be]](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60995-8)
</small>

- But, no single gene...

```{r, fig.cap="[[@Johnson2017-bp]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.06.033)"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/johnson-etal-2017-schiz.jpg")
```

- *NOTCH4*, *TNF*: 
    - Part of major histocompatibility complex (MHC), cell membrane specializations involved in the immune system
- *DRD2* (dopamine D2 receptor), *KCNN3* (Ca+ activated K+ channel), *GRM3* (metabotropic glutamate receptor)

<small>
[[@Johnson2017-bp]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.06.033)
</small>

### Brain abnormalities

#### Ventricles larger, esp in males

```{r, fig.cap="[[@Suddath1990-nn]](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199003223221201)"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/schizophrenia-ventricles.jpg")
```

- Ventricular enlargement increases across time
- Especially in the more impaired

```{r, fig.cap="[[@Davis1998-ki]](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0006-3223(97)00553-2)"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0006322397005532-gr2.gif")
```

knitr::include_graphics("https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0006322397005532-gr3.gif")
```

```{r, fig.cap="[[@Kempton2010-ms]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2010.03.036)"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0920996410012077-gr2_lrg.jpg")
```

- Enlargement precedes diagnosis?
- Like trajectories B or F

```{r, fig.cap="[[@Kempton2010-ms]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2010.03.036)"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0920996410012077-gr3_lrg.jpg")
```

#### Hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, NAc smaller

- Related to ventricular enlargement?
- Early disturbance in brain development?

```{r, fig.cap="[[@Van_Erp2015-ne]](https://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2015.63)"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://images.nature.com/full/nature-assets/mp/journal/v21/n4/images/mp201563f1.jpg")
```

##### Animal model example

- Dentate gyrus (DG) in hippocampus 
    - spatial coding, learning & memory, emotion processing 
- DG dysfunction implicated in schizophrenia
- Gene linked to schizophrenia, Transmembrane protein 108 (Tmem108) enriched in DG granule neurons
- Tmem108 expression increased during postnatal period critical for DG development
- Tmem108-deficient neurons form fewer and smaller spines 
- Tmem108-deficient mice display schizophrenia-relevant behavioral deficits
- [[@jiao_transmembrane_2017]](10.1073/pnas.1618213114)

#### White matter disruption

```{r, fig.cap="[[@Kelly2017-lj]](https://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2017.170)"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.nature.com/lw926/nature-assets/mp/journal/v23/n5/images/mp2017170f1.jpg")
```

- White matter loss over age

```{r, fig.cap="[[@Kochunov2016-cu]](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.23336)"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://wol-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/cms/attachment/66a4c18c-f522-4bb1-a0b0-ed949ac9afd1/hbm23336-fig-0002-m.png")
```

#### Disconnectivity in cortical networks

```{r, fig.cap="[[@Uhlhaas2013-do]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2012.11.004)"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438812001663-gr1.jpg")
```

- But connectivity findings inconsistent [[@Fornito2015-go]](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2014.08.006)
- **Reduced structural** connectivity vs.
    - Synaptic, dendritic, axonal connections b/w regions
    - Usually measured via DTI or related diffusion-based MRI technique
- **Increased functional** connectivity
    - BOLD, EEG, or MEG covariance
    - Task-free 'resting' state or task-based

```{r, fig.cap="[[@Fornito2015-go]](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2014.08.006)"}

Figure 1. De-coupling of network structure and function in schizophrenia. (a) Shows an example of a brain-wide map of structural connectivity deficits in patients with schizophrenia, highlighting a relatively diffuse impairment that particularly affects fronto-posterior anatomical connectivity. In this whole-brain analysis, no increases of structural connectivity were found. Letters denote different regions (see below for key). (b) Illustrates frontal regions showing decreased and increased functional connectivity with seed regions in the dorsal (top) and ventral (bottom) caudate nucleus, respectively, in patients with schizophrenia (yellow, blue) and their unaffected, first-degree relatives (magenta, green). Thus, despite a fairly global impairment of structural connectivity (depicted in (a)), systems-specific increases in functional connectivity can be observed (b). (c,d) Brain-wide alterations of structural (c) and functional (d) connectivity in the same sample of patients with schizophrenia. Blue and green depict links where anatomical and functional connectivity, respectively, were reduced in patients; red depicts links where functional connectivity was increased in the patient group. (a) reproduced from [24•], (b) from [18•], and (c,d) from [23••] with permission. Regional abbreviations in (a) are as follow: A. Left Superior Frontal, B. Right Superior Frontal, C.

- Global signal (cortical gray matter BOLD signal CGm) variations?

```

Fig 1. Power and variance of CGm signal in SCZ and BD. (A) Power of CGm signal in 90 SCZ patients (red) relative to 90 HCS (black) (see SI Appendix, Table S1 for demographics). (B) Mean power across all frequencies before and after GSR indicating an increase in SCZ [F(1, 178) = 7.42, P < 0.01], and attenuation by GSR [F(1, 178) = 5.37, P < 0.025]. (C) CGm variance also showed increases in SCZ [F(1, 178) = 7.25, P < 0.01] and GSR-induced reduction in SCZ [F(1, 178) = 5.25, P < 0.025]. (D–F) Independent SCZ sample (see SI Appendix, Table S2 for demographics), confirming increased CGm power [F(1, 143) = 9.2, P < 0.01] and variance [F(1, 143) = 9.25, P < 0.01] effects, but also the attenuating impact of GSR on power [F(1, 143) = 7.75, P < 0.01] and variance [F(1, 143) = 8.1, P < 0.01]. (G–I) Results for BD patients (n = 73) relative to matched HCS (see SI Appendix, Table S3 for demographics) did not reveal GSR effects observed in SCZ samples [F(1, 127) = 2.89, P = 0.092, n.s.] and no evidence for increase in CGm power or variance. All effects remained when examining all gray matter voxels (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Error bars mark ± 1 SEM. ***P < 0.001 level of significance. n.s., not significant.

Fig 2. Relationship between SCZ symptoms and CGm BOLD signal power. We extracted average CGm power for each patient with available symptom ratings (n = 153). (A) Significant positive relationship between CGm power and symptom ratings in SCZ (r = 0.18, P < 0.03), verified using Spearman’s ρ given somewhat nonnormally distributed data (ρ = 0.2, P < 0.015). (B and C) Results held across SCZ samples, increasing confidence in the effect (i.e., joint probability of independent effects P < 0.002, marked in blue boxes). All identified relationships held when examining Gm variance (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Notably, all effects were no longer significant after GSR, suggesting GS carries clinically meaningful information. The shaded area marks the 95% confidence interval around the best-fit line.

### Neurochemical factors
#### Dopamine hypothesis

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mesolimbocortical-da.jpg")
```

##### Evidence for...

- DA ($D_2$ receptor) antagonists (e.g. chlorpromazine)
    + improve positive symptoms
- *Typical antipsychotics* are DA $D_2$ antagonists
- DA agonists
    + amphetamine, cocaine, L-DOPA
    + mimic or exacerbate symptoms
    
##### Evidence against...

- New, *atypical antipsychotics* 
    + (e.g. Clozapine) INCREASE DA in frontal cortex, affect 5-HT
- Mixed evidence for high DA metabolite levels in CSF
- Some DA neurons may release 5-HT, cannabinoids, glutamate [[@Seutin2005-wx]](https://doi.org/https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.bjp.0706328)

#### Glutamate/ketamine hypothesis

- *Psychomimetic* drugs induce schizophrenia-like states
    + Phencyclidine (PCP), ketamine
    + NMDA receptor antagonists
- Ketamine
  - dissociative (secondary) anesthetic
  - side effects include hallucinations, blurred vision, delirium, floating sensations, vivid dreams
  - binds to serotonin ($5HT_{2a}$) receptor, $\kappa$ opioid receptor, and $\sigma$ receptor "chaperone"
  - may be dopamine $D_2$ receptor antagonist
- Schizophrenia $\rightarrow$ *underactivation* of NMDA receptors?
    - NMDA receptor role in learning, plasticity
    - DG neurons in [[@jiao_transmembrane_2017]](10.1073/pnas.1618213114) were glutamate-releasing.
- NMDAR antagonists -> neurodegeneration, excitotoxicity, & apoptosis

### Developmental origins

#### Rapid gray matter loss in adolescents?

```{r, fig.cap="[[@thompson_mapping_2001]](https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.201243998)"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/thompson-2001-F2.large.jpg")
```

#### Early life stress

- 2x greater odds for children in urban environments
- Higher risk among migrant populations [[@Cantor-Graae2005-ej]](https://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.1.12)
- Exposure to infection *in utero*, other birth complications
- Exposure to cannibis
- Paternal age > 40

#### Complex pathways

- [[@levine_transgenerational_2016]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2016.06.019)
  - Children (N=51,233) of parents who born during Nazi era (1922-1945)
  - Emigrated before (indirect exposure) or after (direct exposure) to Nazi era
  - Children exposed to direct stress of Nazi era *in utero* or postnatally
      + Did **not** differ in rates of schizophrenia, but
      + Had higher rehospitalization rates
- [[@debost_investigating_2015]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.05.013)
  - Danish cohort (n=1,141,447)
  - Exposure to early life stress 
      + *in utero* did **not** increase risk of schizophrenia, but
      + during 0-2 years increased risk
  - Increased risk associated with an allele of a cortisol-related gene

## In summary

- Wide-ranging disturbance of mood, thought, action, perception
- Broad changes in brain structure, function, chemistry, development
- ~~Dopamine hypothesis~~ giving way to glutamate hypothesis
- Genetic (polygenic = multiple genes) risk + environmental factors

## Prospects

### Outcomes following hospitalization

```
<!-- Less than 50% positive; less than 50% negative; Mixed and non-systematic. -->
