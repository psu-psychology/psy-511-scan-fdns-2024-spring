## Choose a behavior or mental state you want to (better) understand

- Take an information processing perspective and briefly sketch out (in no more than a short paragraph) the main inputs, outputs, and computations involved.
- When thinking about *outputs* make sure to distinguish between *behaviors* (e.g., movements, facial expressions, vocalizations) and *physiological states* (e.g., changes in heart rate, hormone concentrations in the blood, etc.)

- Causal diagrams
- Covariates, external influences
