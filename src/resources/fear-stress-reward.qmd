## The brain bases of emotion

[@Lindquist2012-jr](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X11000446)

### Locationist account

- *Where* in the brain is emotion processed?

Brain regions hypothesized to be associated with emotion categories are depicted. Here we depict the most popular locationist hypotheses, although other locationist hypotheses of brain–emotion correspondence exist (e.g., Panksepp, Reference Panksepp1998). Fear: amygdala (yellow); Disgust: insula (green); Anger: OFC (rust); Sadness: ACC (blue).

### Constructionist account

> A psychological constructionist account of emotion assumes that emotions are psychological events that emerge out of more basic psychological operations that are not specific to emotion. In this view, mental categories such as anger, sadness, fear, et cetera, are not respected by the brain (nor are emotion, perception, or cognition, for that matter.

> ...emotions emerge when people make meaning out of sensory input from the body and from the world using knowledge of prior experiences. Emotions are “situated conceptualizations” (cf. Barsalou 2003) because the emerging meaning is tailored to the immediate environment and prepares the person to respond to sensory input in a way that is tailored to the situation

> Figure 4. The Neural Reference Space for Discrete Emotion. The neural reference space (phrase coined by Edelman [1989]) is the set of brain regions consistently activated across all studies assessing the experience or perception of anger, disgust, fear, happiness and sadness (i.e. the superordinate category emotion). Brain regions in yellow exceeded the height threshold ($p<.05$) and regions in orange exceeded the most stringent extent-based threshold ($p<.001$). Regions in pink and magenta correspond to lesser extent-based thresholds and are not discussed in this article. Cortex is grey, the brainstem and nucleus accumbens are green, the amygdala is blue and the cerebellum is purple.

> Figure 5. Logistic Regression Findings. Selected results from the logistic regressions are presented (for additional findings, see Table S6 in supplementary materials). Circles with positive values represent a 100% increase in the odds that a variable predicted an increase in activity in that brain area. Circles with negative values represent a 100% increase in the odds that a variable predicted there would not be an increase in activity in that brain area. Legend: Blue lines: left hemisphere; Green lines: right hemisphere. Arrowheads: % change in odds is greater than values represented in this figure. Abbreviations: OFC: orbitofrontal cortex; DLPFC: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; ATL: anterior temporal lobe; VLPFC: ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; DMPFC: dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; aMCC: anterior mid-cingulate cortex; sAAC: subgenual ACC.

The y-axes plot the proportion of study contrasts in our database that had increased activation within 10mm of that brain area. The x-axes denote the contrast type separated by experience (exp) and perception (per). All brain regions depicted are in the right hemisphere.

#### Amygdala as a 'hub' for *fear*

> Our meta-analytic findings were inconsistent with a locationist hypothesis of amygdala function but were more consistent with the psychological constructionist hypothesis. Our density analyses revealed that, as compared to other brain regions, voxels within both amygdalae had more consistent increases in activation during instances of fear perception than during the perception of any other emotion category (Table 1). These voxels were not functionally specific for instances of perceiving fear, however. 

#### Anterior insula as 'hub' for *disgust*

> Our meta-analytic findings were inconsistent with the locationist account that the anterior insula is the brain seat of disgust but were more consistent with the psychological constructionist account that insula activity is correlated with interoception and the awareness of affective feelings.

#### Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as 'hub' for *anger*

> Our meta-analytic findings were inconsistent with the locationist hypothesis that the OFC is the brain seat of anger. As compared to voxels within other brain regions, voxels within the OFC did not have more consistent increases during instances of anger experience or perception than during any other emotion category. Rather, as compared to voxels within other brain regions, voxels within the left lOFC had more consistent increases in activation during instances of disgust experience than during the experience of other emotion categories.

#### Anterior cingulate cortex as 'hub' for *sadness*

> Our meta-analytic evidence is inconsistent with the locationist account that the ACC is the brain basis of sadness, but more consistent with a psychological constructionist hypothesis of ACC function. As compared to voxels within other brain regions, voxels within the sACC, pACC and aMCC did not have more consistent increases when participants were experiencing or perceiving instances of sadness than during any other emotion category (Fig. 6).

## Stress types

- **Acute** stress
    + Short duration
- Brain detects threat
- Mobilizes physiological, behavioral responses
    + HPA (Cortisol), SAM (NE/Epi) axes
- vs. **Chronic** or stress
    + Long duration, persistent
    
### Glucocorticoids

- Adrenal cortex releases hormones
+ Cortisol (hydrocortisone)
    * Increases blood glucose levels
    * Suppresses immune system
    * Reduces inflammation
    * Aids in metabolism
+ Receptors in body and brain

#### Changes in neural architecture

- Prefrontal cortex

#### Neurochemical factors

- Cortisol enhances glutamate release
- Corticosteroid antagonists block this
- Ketamine (NMDA receptor antagonist) may act via similar mechanisms

### Reward

- A *reward* reinforces (makes more prevalent/probable) some behavior
- Milner and Olds [[@milner_discovery_1989]](http://doi.org/10.1016/S0149-7634(89)80013-2) discovered 'rewarding' power of electrical self-stimulation
- [[@heath1963electrical]](http://doi.org/10.1176/ajp.120.6.571) studied effects in human patients.
