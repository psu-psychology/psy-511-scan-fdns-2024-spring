## Getting to know you...

#### 1. Pick two papers you want to read and (better) understand

- Email me APA formatted citation (with DOIs)
- Indicate three concepts/terms you are especially interested in understanding

#### 2. Choose a behavior or mental state you want to (better) understand

- Take an information processing perspective and briefly sketch out (in no more than a short paragraph) the main inputs, outputs, and computations involved.
- When thinking about *outputs* make sure to distinguish between *behaviors* (e.g., movements, facial expressions, vocalizations) and *physiological states* (e.g., changes in heart rate, hormone concentrations in the blood, etc.)
