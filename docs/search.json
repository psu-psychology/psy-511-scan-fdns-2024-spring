Stressors activate brainstem and/or forebrain limbic structures. The brainstem can generate rapid hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses through direct projections to hypophysiotrophic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) or to preganglionic autonomic neurons (stress response triggers). By contrast, forebrain limbic regions have no direct connections with the HPA axis or the ANS and thus require intervening synapses before they can access autonomic or neuroendocrine neurons (top-down regulation). A high proportion of these intervening neurons are located in hypothalamic nuclei that are also responsive to homeostatic status, providing a mechanism by which the descending limbic information can be modulated according to the physiological status of the animal (‘middle management’). BST, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; CVO, circumventricular organ; SAM, sympathoadrenomedullary system.\n(Ulrich-Lai & Herman, 2009)\n\n\nNeural response\n\nSympathetic Adrenal Medulla (SAM) response\nSympathetic NS activation of adrenal medulla, other organs\nReleases NE and Epi into bloodstream\n\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fnrn2647/MediaObjects/41583_2009_Article_BFnrn2647_Fig2_HTML.jpg?as=webp\")\n\n\n\n\n(Ulrich-Lai & Herman, 2009)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The brain circuitry that regulates autonomic stress responses. Stress-induced pre-autonomic outflow originates in multiple brain areas. The colours denote brain regions that are implicated in sympathetic activation (blue), parasympathetic activation (red) or both (bicoloured). The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) has substantial projections to both sympathetic and parasympathetic nuclei, including the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMX), the intermediolateral cell column (IML), the locus coeruleus (LC) and the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) (the latter two sets of projections are not shown for clarity). The rostral VLM, LC and PVN directly innervate the IML and are thought to initiate sympathetic responses. The NTS in turn receives direct input from neurons in the infralimbic cortex (IL), the central amygdala (CeA) and the PVN. Other hypothalamic regions, most notably the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), modulate autonomic nervous system activation through connections with the PVN (and possibly other descending pathways) (see main text). Parasympathetic outflow is mediated largely by descending outputs from the DMX and the nucleus ambiguus (NA) and is under the direct influence of the prelimbic cortex (PL), the PVN and possibly other descending relays (see main text). Parasympathetic effects of the anterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (aBST) are probably mediated by relays in the PVN or the NTS. The anatomical complexity of autonomic nervous system integration is underscored by the mixing of sympathetic and parasympathetic projection neurons in individual nuclei.\n(Ulrich-Lai & Herman, 2009)\n\n\nEndocrine response\n\nHypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) axis\nAdrenal hormones released\n\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"https://journals.physiology.org/cms/10.1152/physrev.00042.2017/asset/images/medium/z9j0041828650001.gif\")\n\n\n\n\n(Deussing & Chen, 2018)\n\n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 1.

Stress-induced activation of the dorsal part of the medial parvocellular paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVNmpd) originates in several brain regions (excitatory inputs are coloured blue with solid lines and inhibitory (GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-ergic) inputs are coloured red with dashed lines). The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) receives direct noradrenergic, adrenergic and peptidergic innervation from the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). The dorsomedial components of the dorsomedial hypothalamus (dmDMH) and the arcuate nucleus (Arc) provide intrahypothalamic stress excitation. The anterior part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), particularly the anteroventral nucleus of the BST (avBST), activates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis stress responses. The PVN also receives a stress-excitatory drive from the dorsal raphe, the tuberomammillary nucleus, the supramammillary nucleus and the spinal cord, among others (omitted in the interest of space). Activation of the PVNmpd is inhibited by numerous hypothalamic circuits, including the medial preoptic area (mPOA), the ventrolateral component of the dorsomedial hypothalamus (vlDMH) and local neurons in the peri-PVN region (pPVN), encompassing the PVN surround and the subparaventricular zone. The posterior subregions of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (pBST) provide a prominent forebrain inhibition of HPA axis responses; most of these inputs are GABAergic.

In this course, we will explore the historical roots and contemporary challenges associated with the study of biological approaches to complex adaptive behavior. In doing so, we will read and examine critically primary source readings that discuss basic patterns and processes of brain structure and function. The goal is to provide students with a basic foundation of knowledge about the structures and functions of the nervous system that can provide the basis for future study.\nThis course is one of two required courses for the Specialization in Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience (SCAN)."

    "text": "Academic Integrity\nPenn State defines academic integrity as the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. All students should act with personal integrity, respect others dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts (Faculty Senate Policy 49-20). Sanctions for academic misconduct can include a grade of F for the course as well as other penalties.\nStudents are responsible for maintaining academic integrity. Violations include cheating on exams, talking to others during exams, looking at another student’s test materials or answers during an exam, removing exams from the classroom without consent from the instructor, plagiarizing (do not copy from someone else!), and dishonesty in any aspect of course participation.\nWhen you complete assignments, remember the ABCs to avoid plagiarism: Always place copied information within quotation marks, include information about the quoted or paraphrased source in a Bibliography, and Cite the source in the body (in the text) of your paper immediately after the quoted or paraphrased information. When in doubt, cite in the text and include the source in a bibliography.\n\n\nLate, missed or make-up assignments\n\nExams\nMake-up exams may be permitted under unusual circumstances such as (a) an interview, (b) illness, (c) religious observance, (d) the death of a family member, or (e) any other event recognized by the university as a valid excuse for absence from class.\nIf you must miss class on the day an exam is scheduled, you must do the following:\n\nContact the TA or the instructor by telephone, email, or in person in advance of the exam. Twenty-four hours notice is expected. If you do not contact the TA or instructor in advance, it is possible that you may not be able to schedule a make-up exam.\nArrange with the TA or instructor to take a make-up exam as soon as possible, but no later than one (1) week following the date of the scheduled exam. It is your responsibility, not the TA’s or the instructor’s to schedule an approved make-up exam in a timely way.\n\n\n\nQuizzes\nNo make-up quizzes will be given except under unusual circumstances. You may ask for a copy of the quiz for studying purposes, however.\n\n\nAccommodation for persons with disabilities\nPenn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Please refer to the information provided by Student Disability Resources (SDR) at http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/ for information about the procedures required to obtain reasonable accommodations in this course. Students should discussSDR-approved accommodations with their instructor as early in the semester as possible, even if they have taken another course with the instructor. Please note: students are not required to provide their instructor with information about the nature of their condition.\nPenn State students are also welcome to contact other units for assistance with personal concerns that interfere with academic progress, including: Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS; http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/counseling/), the Office of Student Affairs (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/), Career Services (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/career/), the Center for Women Students (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/womenscenter/), the LGBTQA Student Resource Center (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/lgbtqa/), the Office of Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response (http://titleix.psu.edu/), Penn State Educational Equity (http://equity.psu.edu/), the Multicultural Resource Center (http://equity.psu.edu/mrc), and University Health Services (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/health/).\n\n\n\nNondiscrimination Statement\nThe Pennsylvania State University is committed to equal access to programs, facilities, admission and employment for all persons. It is the policy of the University to maintain an environment free of harassment and free of discrimination against any person because of age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, creed, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, genetic information or political ideas. Discriminatory conduct and harassment, as well as sexual misconduct and relationship violence, violates the dignity of individuals, impedes the realization of the University’s educational mission, and will not be tolerated.\nDirect all inquiries regarding the nondiscrimination policy to:\nDr. Kenneth Lehrman III Vice Provost for Affirmative Action Affirmative Action Office The Pennsylvania State University 328 Boucke Building University Park, PA 16802-5901 Email: kfl2@psu.edu Tel (814) 863-0471\n\n\nDiversity Statement\nThis classroom is a place where you will be treated with respect. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class. Penn State is committed to creating an educational environment which is free from intolerance directed toward individuals or groups and strives to create and maintain an environment that fosters respect for others as stated in Policy AD29 Statement on Intolerance.\n\n\nMandated Reporting Statement\nPenn State’s policies require me, as a faculty member, to share information about incidents of sex-based discrimination and harassment (discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and retaliation) with Penn State’s Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators, regardless of whether the incidents are stated to me in person or shared by students as part of their coursework. For more information regarding the University’s policies and procedures for responding to reports of sexual or gender-based harassment or misconduct, please visit http://titleix.psu.edu.\nAdditionally, I am required to make a report on any reasonable suspicion of child abuse in accordance with the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law."

The cells were filled with biocytin, stained and imaged following patch clamp recording (see part b). Each subclass has distinct morphological features. For the four interneurons on the left, the dendrites are shown in dark grey and the axons in light grey. The soma of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A-expressing (HTR3A+) sparse neuro- gliaform cell is located in layer 1, and its axons are also concentrated in this layer. The vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP+) bipolar cell has a characteristic bipolar dendritic extension. The soma of the somatostatin-expressing (SST+) deep Martinotti cell is located in layer 5/6, and its axons extend upward into layer 1. The parvalbumin-expressing (PVALB+) basket cell has basket-like axonal arborisation. For the excitatory neuron on the right, the apical dendrites are shown in dark grey and the basal dendrites in light grey. This is a layer 5, thick-tufted cell from a retinol-binding protein 4 (Rbp4) gene promoter-driven Cre-expressing mouse. The cell features thick apical dendritic tufts extending into layer 1. These morphological features are consistent with those described in published reports49,130,140. b | Differential electrophysiological responses of the five subclasses of neurons shown in part a to square pulses of current in patch clamp recordings. For example, the HTR3A+ cell is late spiking, whereas the PVALB+ cell is fast spiking. These responses are consistent with those described in published reports49,130,140. c | Differential molecular signatures of the five subclasses of cortical neurons illustrated in part a derived from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. The violin plot shows the collective gene expression profile for each gene of all the cells in a type (cluster). We define the smallest discrete clusters of cells as types and the aggregates of types that share common features as classes or subclasses. Each transcriptomic cell type is shown as a column of data points with the same colour (the colour coding corresponds to that of the transcriptomic taxonomy shown in Fig. 5). Shown here are three interneuron cell types expressing Htr3a but notVip, six interneuron cell types expressing Vip, six interneuron cell types expressing Sst and seven interneuron cell types expressing Pvalb. All of the interneurons express glutamate decarboxylase 1 (Gad1). Also shown are eight layer 5 excitatory neuron types, all of which express solute carrier family 17 member 7 (Slc17a7). All of the cells express synaptosome-associated protein 25 (Snap25). The height of each ‘violin’-shaped data point represents the range of expression levels of the gene, and the width represents the proportion of cells displaying a particular level of expression. Parts a and b are from the Allen Cell Types Database (see Further Information). Part c is adapted with permission from Ref. 136.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Figure 6 from Zeng & Sanes, 2017). The figure shows a proposed hierarchical classification of cells in the retina (a) and cerebral cortex (b). In both areas, individual cell types can be grouped into classes, and intermediate levels of subclasses can be determined based on distinct morphological, physiological and molecular features. Higher-order groupings (such as those shown in part a, including sensory neurons, interneurons and projection neurons) may emerge once enough areas have been provided and compared. Types are the commonly recognized (‘validated’) terminal branches in the current hierarchical arrangement of cell types. Lower-order groupings into subtypes may largely be provisional until additional data are collected that could determine if they could form new types or should be merged into other types. Dashed lines indicate the presence of additional types that cannot be labelled due to lack of space. The question marks in part a indicate that the hierarchical relationship among the indicated cell types remains unclear. The question mark in part b indicates that the status of the cortical cell groups indicated may be either subclasses, types or subtypes. CT, cortico-thalamic neurons; DS, direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (RGCs); F, forkhead box P2 (Foxp2)-expressing RGCs; HTR3A, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A; ipRGC, intrinsically photosensitive RGCs; IT, intratelencephalic neurons; L4, layer 4; L6b, layer 6b subplate neurons; nGnG, non-GABAergic-non-glycinergic amacrine cells; ooDSGC, ON-OFF direction-selective RGCs; PT, pyramidal tract neurons; PVALB, parvalbumin; SST, somatostatin; VIP, vasoactive intestinal peptide.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Figure 4 from Boldog et al., 2018). a, Examples of different firing patterns induced by current injections in layer 1 interneurons. Firing pattern of an RC (top), an NGFC (middle), and an unidentified layer 1 interneuron (bottom). b, SVM-based wrapper-feature selection of electrophysiological parameters for the identification of RCs. Anatomically identified RCs (red dots) and other types of interneurons with known morphology (black dots) are mapped to the distribution of electrophysiological features ranked as the two best delineators by SVM. Black lines show the best hyperplane separating RCs from other interneuron types. c,d, RCs exhibit a distinct impedance profile relative to neurogliaform and other human interneurons in layer 1. (c) Individual responses of anatomically identified rosehip (red), neurogliaform (blue), and other (black) interneurons to current injections with an exponential chirp (0.2–200 Hz; top). Traces were normalized to the amplitude of the rosehip response at 200 Hz. (d) Left: normalized impedance (Z) profiles of distinct groups of interneurons. RCs (n=5) had higher impedance in the range of 0.9–12.4 Hz compared to neurogliaform (n=5) and other (n=5) interneurons. Shaded regions represent s.d. Right: impedances were similar at the lowest frequency (Z0.2 Hz; left), but resonance magnitude (Q) calculated as maximal impedance value divided by the impedance at lowest frequency (middle) and frequencies of maximal impedance (fmax; right) showed significant differences (P &lt; 0.05, ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc correction). e, Automatized selection of recording periods for assessing subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (boxed segments) and detection of bursts (bars) for measuring intraburst spiking frequency demonstrated on an RC response to near-rheobasic stimulation showing stuttering firing behavior. f, Averaged fast fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) of membrane potential oscillations had higher power between 3.8 and 80 Hz in RCs compared to neurogliaform and other interneurons. g, Intraburst frequency of RCs peaked in the gamma range.
