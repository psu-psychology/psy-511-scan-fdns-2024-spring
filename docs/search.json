Interoceptive Information and Its Integration with Emotional, Cognitive, and Motivational Signals from an Array of Cortical and Subcortical Regions. Interoceptive information of constantly changing body states arrives in the posterior insula by ascending sensory inputs from dedicated spinal and brainstem pathways via specific thalamic relays. This information is projected rostrally onto the anterior insula, where it is integrated with emotional, cognitive, and motivational signals from an array of cortical and subcortical regions. As a result, the anterior insula supports unique subjective feeling states. The anterior insula regulates the introduction of subjective feelings into cognitive and motivational processes by virtue of its cortical location at the cross-roads of numerous pathways involved in higher cognition and motivation. Abbreviations: AI, anterior insula; AMG, amygdala; dACC, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; DLPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; PI, posterior insula; THAL, thalamus; VMPFC, ventromedial prefrontal cortex; VS, ventral striatum.\n(Namkung et al., 2017)"

Animal phylogeny. A simplified animal phylogenetic tree (showing the evolutionary history of animals), in which lines represent evolutionary diversification. The lengths of the lines are arbitrary, as they do not indicate evolutionary distance. For a brief characterization of the Anthozoa, Bilateria, Ceriantharia, Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Medusozoa and Neuralia, see the glossary. The phylogenetic position of the Ctenophora is not settled, as indicated by a question mark. The Ctenophora image is adapted with permission from Ref. 43, Wiley. The Porifera and Placozoa images are reprinted with permission from Ref. 139 (Nielsen, C.

Comparison of neurodevelopment in the frog, annelid and sea anemone. The frog Xenopus laevis (part a), the annelid Platynereis dumerilii (part b) and the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis (part c) are depicted in their gastrula-like stages (gastrula, trochophora and planula, respectively; upper panels), intermediate developmental (neurula, metatrochophora and late planula, respectively; middle panels) and juvenile stages (tadpole, nectochaete and polyp, respectively; lower panels). Colours demarcate developmental neurogenic regions, and double-headed arrows show the apical (AP)–blastoporal (BL) axis. All views in parts a–c are lateral. At gastrula stages (upper panels), blastoporal ectodermal tissue (around the closing blastopore; red) and apical pole ectodermal tissue (violet) can be distinguished. At subsequent stages, a large part of the ectoderm — incluing the former apical and blastoporal regions — gives rise to neurogenic tissue. The neurogenic tissue comprises regions of distinct molecular identity (indicated by different colours), which will give rise to different parts of the nervous system. In the frog (part a), the neural plate (violet, red and yellow) comprises future forebrain tissue, as well as medial and lateral neural tube tissue; it is laterally bounded by developing peripheral nervous system components (blue). Similar regions are apparent in the annelid (part b), and these give rise to the brain, medial and lateral nerve cord and peripheral nervous system. As reasoned in this article, these regions also exist in the cnidarian (part c). In the frog and annelid worm, these regions are further subdivided into specific subregions by the activity of molecular organizing signals\n\n\n\nNeurons and nervous systems 520-570 M years old\nDiverse nervous systems show developmental similarities at molecular level"

Lateral views of the brains of some mammals to show the evolutionary development of the neocortex (gray). In the hedgehog almost the entire neocortex is occupied by sensory and motor areas. In the prosimian Galago the sensory cortical areas are separated by an area occupied by association cortex (AS). A second area of association cortex is found in front of the motor cortex. In man these anterior and posterior association areas are strongly developed. A, primary auditory cortex; AS, association cortex; Ent, entorhinal cortex; I, insula; M, primary motor cortex; PF, prefrontal cortex; PM, premotor cortex; S, primary somatosensory cortex; V, primary visual cortex.

Shared nonneuronal scaling rules and structure- and order-specific neuronal scaling rules for mammalian brains. Each point represents the average values for one species (insectivores, blue; rodents, green; primates, red; Scandentia, orange). Arrows point to human data points, circles represent the cerebral cortex, squares represent the cerebellum, and triangles represent the rest of the brain (excluding the olfactory bulb). (A) Clade- and structure-specific scaling of brain structure mass as a function of numbers of neurons. Allometric exponents: cerebral cortex: 1.699 (Glires), 1.598 (insectivores), 1.087 or linear (primates); cerebellum: 1.305 (Glires), 1.028 or linear (insectivores), 0.976 or linear (primates); rest of the brain: 1.568 (Glires), 1.297 (insectivores), 1.198 (or 1.4 when corrected for phylogenetic relatedness in the dataset, primates). (B) Neuronal cell densities scale differently across structures and orders but are always larger in primates than in Glires. Allometric exponents: cerebral cortex: −0.424 (Glires), −0.569 (insectivores), −0.168 (primates); cerebellum: −0.271 (Glires), not significant (insectivores and primates); rest of the brain: −0.467 (Glires), not significant (insectivores), −0.220 (primates). (C) Mass of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and rest of the brain varies as a similar function of their respective numbers of nonneuronal cells.

(D) Average density of nonneuronal cells in each structure does not vary systematically with structure mass across species. Power functions are not plotted so as not to obscure the data points.

In this course, we will explore the historical roots and contemporary challenges associated with the study of biological approaches to complex adaptive behavior. In doing so, we will read and examine critically primary source readings that discuss basic patterns and processes of brain structure and function. The goal is to provide students with a basic foundation of knowledge about the structures and functions of the nervous system that can provide the basis for future study.\nThis course is one of two required courses for the Specialization in Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience (SCAN)."

All students should act with personal integrity, respect others dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts (Faculty Senate Policy 49-20). Sanctions for academic misconduct can include a grade of F for the course as well as other penalties.\nStudents are responsible for maintaining academic integrity. Violations include cheating on exams, talking to others during exams, looking at another student’s test materials or answers during an exam, removing exams from the classroom without consent from the instructor, plagiarizing (do not copy from someone else!), and dishonesty in any aspect of course participation.\nWhen you complete assignments, remember the ABCs to avoid plagiarism: Always place copied information within quotation marks, include information about the quoted or paraphrased source in a Bibliography, and Cite the source in the body (in the text) of your paper immediately after the quoted or paraphrased information. When in doubt, cite in the text and include the source in a bibliography.\n\n\nLate, missed or make-up assignments\n\nExams\nMake-up exams may be permitted under unusual circumstances such as (a) an interview, (b) illness, (c) religious observance, (d) the death of a family member, or (e) any other event recognized by the university as a valid excuse for absence from class.\nIf you must miss class on the day an exam is scheduled, you must do the following:\n\nContact the TA or the instructor by telephone, email, or in person in advance of the exam. Twenty-four hours notice is expected. If you do not contact the TA or instructor in advance, it is possible that you may not be able to schedule a make-up exam.\nArrange with the TA or instructor to take a make-up exam as soon as possible, but no later than one (1) week following the date of the scheduled exam. It is your responsibility, not the TA’s or the instructor’s to schedule an approved make-up exam in a timely way.\n\n\n\nQuizzes\nNo make-up quizzes will be given except under unusual circumstances. You may ask for a copy of the quiz for studying purposes, however.\n\n\nAccommodation for persons with disabilities\nPenn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Please refer to the information provided by Student Disability Resources (SDR) at http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/ for information about the procedures required to obtain reasonable accommodations in this course. Students should discussSDR-approved accommodations with their instructor as early in the semester as possible, even if they have taken another course with the instructor.

Neurons can be classified using morphological, physiological and molecular criteria. a | Representative examples of five subclasses of cortical neurons obtained from brain slices. The cells were filled with biocytin, stained and imaged following patch clamp recording (see part b). Each subclass has distinct morphological features. For the four interneurons on the left, the dendrites are shown in dark grey and the axons in light grey. The soma of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A-expressing (HTR3A+) sparse neuro- gliaform cell is located in layer 1, and its axons are also concentrated in this layer. The vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP+) bipolar cell has a characteristic bipolar dendritic extension. The soma of the somatostatin-expressing (SST+) deep Martinotti cell is located in layer 5/6, and its axons extend upward into layer 1. The parvalbumin-expressing (PVALB+) basket cell has basket-like axonal arborisation. For the excitatory neuron on the right, the apical dendrites are shown in dark grey and the basal dendrites in light grey. This is a layer 5, thick-tufted cell from a retinol-binding protein 4 (Rbp4) gene promoter-driven Cre-expressing mouse. The cell features thick apical dendritic tufts extending into layer 1. These morphological features are consistent with those described in published reports49,130,140. b | Differential electrophysiological responses of the five subclasses of neurons shown in part a to square pulses of current in patch clamp recordings. For example, the HTR3A+ cell is late spiking, whereas the PVALB+ cell is fast spiking. These responses are consistent with those described in published reports49,130,140. c | Differential molecular signatures of the five subclasses of cortical neurons illustrated in part a derived from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. The violin plot shows the collective gene expression profile for each gene of all the cells in a type (cluster). We define the smallest discrete clusters of cells as types and the aggregates of types that share common features as classes or subclasses. Each transcriptomic cell type is shown as a column of data points with the same colour (the colour coding corresponds to that of the transcriptomic taxonomy shown in Fig. 5). Shown here are three interneuron cell types expressing Htr3a but notVip, six interneuron cell types expressing Vip, six interneuron cell types expressing Sst and seven interneuron cell types expressing Pvalb. All of the interneurons express glutamate decarboxylase 1 (Gad1). Also shown are eight layer 5 excitatory neuron types, all of which express solute carrier family 17 member 7 (Slc17a7). All of the cells express synaptosome-associated protein 25 (Snap25). The height of each ‘violin’-shaped data point represents the range of expression levels of the gene, and the width represents the proportion of cells displaying a particular level of expression. Parts a and b are from the Allen Cell Types Database (see Further Information). Part c is adapted with permission from Ref. 136.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Figure 6 from Zeng & Sanes, 2017). The figure shows a proposed hierarchical classification of cells in the retina (a) and cerebral cortex (b). In both areas, individual cell types can be grouped into classes, and intermediate levels of subclasses can be determined based on distinct morphological, physiological and molecular features. Higher-order groupings (such as those shown in part a, including sensory neurons, interneurons and projection neurons) may emerge once enough areas have been provided and compared. Types are the commonly recognized (‘validated’) terminal branches in the current hierarchical arrangement of cell types. Lower-order groupings into subtypes may largely be provisional until additional data are collected that could determine if they could form new types or should be merged into other types. Dashed lines indicate the presence of additional types that cannot be labelled due to lack of space. The question marks in part a indicate that the hierarchical relationship among the indicated cell types remains unclear. The question mark in part b indicates that the status of the cortical cell groups indicated may be either subclasses, types or subtypes. CT, cortico-thalamic neurons; DS, direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (RGCs); F, forkhead box P2 (Foxp2)-expressing RGCs; HTR3A, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A; ipRGC, intrinsically photosensitive RGCs; IT, intratelencephalic neurons; L4, layer 4; L6b, layer 6b subplate neurons; nGnG, non-GABAergic-non-glycinergic amacrine cells; ooDSGC, ON-OFF direction-selective RGCs; PT, pyramidal tract neurons; PVALB, parvalbumin; SST, somatostatin; VIP, vasoactive intestinal peptide.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Figure 4 from Boldog et al., 2018). a, Examples of different firing patterns induced by current injections in layer 1 interneurons. Firing pattern of an RC (top), an NGFC (middle), and an unidentified layer 1 interneuron (bottom). b, SVM-based wrapper-feature selection of electrophysiological parameters for the identification of RCs. Anatomically identified RCs (red dots) and other types of interneurons with known morphology (black dots) are mapped to the distribution of electrophysiological features ranked as the two best delineators by SVM. Black lines show the best hyperplane separating RCs from other interneuron types. c,d, RCs exhibit a distinct impedance profile relative to neurogliaform and other human interneurons in layer 1. (c) Individual responses of anatomically identified rosehip (red), neurogliaform (blue), and other (black) interneurons to current injections with an exponential chirp (0.2–200 Hz; top). Traces were normalized to the amplitude of the rosehip response at 200 Hz. (d) Left: normalized impedance (Z) profiles of distinct groups of interneurons. RCs (n=5) had higher impedance in the range of 0.9–12.4 Hz compared to neurogliaform (n=5) and other (n=5) interneurons. Shaded regions represent s.d. Right: impedances were similar at the lowest frequency (Z0.2 Hz; left), but resonance magnitude (Q) calculated as maximal impedance value divided by the impedance at lowest frequency (middle) and frequencies of maximal impedance (fmax; right) showed significant differences (P &lt; 0.05, ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc correction). e, Automatized selection of recording periods for assessing subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (boxed segments) and detection of bursts (bars) for measuring intraburst spiking frequency demonstrated on an RC response to near-rheobasic stimulation showing stuttering firing behavior. f, Averaged fast fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) of membrane potential oscillations had higher power between 3.8 and 80 Hz in RCs compared to neurogliaform and other interneurons. g, Intraburst frequency of RCs peaked in the gamma range.

(B) Neuroblasts are present in the subventricular zone also in humans, and new neurons integrate in the adjacent striatum, which plays an essential role in movement coordination, procedural learning, and memory, as well as motivational and emotional control. New neurons are continuously generated in the DG of the hippocampus—a brain structure essential for memory and mood control—in both rodents and humans (A, B). A limited subpopulation of DG neurons are subject to exchange in rodents (C), whereas the majority turn over in humans (D) [4–6].

    "text": "From structural development to functional development\n\n\n\n(M. H. Johnson, 2001). Figure 3: Three accounts of the neural basis of an advance in behavioural abilities in infants. a | A maturational view in which the neuroanatomical maturation of one region, in this case the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPC), allows new behavioural abilities to emerge. Specifically, maturation of DLPC has been associated with successful performance in the object retrieval task (Fig. 1a)50. Note that although the task itself involves activity in several regions, it is thought to be maturation of only one of these, the DLPC, that results in changed behaviour. b | An interactive specialization view in which the onset of a new behavioural ability is due to changes in the interactions between several regions that were already partially active. In this hypothetical illustration, it is suggested that changes in the interactions between DLPC, parietal cortex and cerebellum might give rise to successful performance in the object retrieval paradigm. In contrast to the maturational view, it is refinement of the connectivity between regions, rather than within a single region, that is important. According to this view, regions adjust their functionality together to allow new computations. c | A skill-learning model, in which the pattern of activation of cortical regions changes during the acquisition of new skills throughout the lifespan. In the example illustrated there is decreasing activation of DLPC and medial frontal cortex (pre-supplementary motor area), accompanied by increasing activation of more posterior regions (such as intraparietal sulcus), as human adults perform a visuomotor sequence learning task77. It is suggested that similar changes might occur during the acquisition of new skills by infants. These three accounts are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\n\n\n\nDifferent hardware = different computations?\n\nResearchers routinely use motor behaviors (e.g., eye, face, and limb movements) to index cognition in the human neonate.\n\n\nWhen developmental researchers use infant movements to index cognition, they often assume that the cortex is involved in producing the behavior.\n\n\nHowever, cortical control of movement is absent at birth, emerging gradually over the first several postnatal months and beyond; before cortical outflow emerges, brainstem networks produce complex motor behavior.\n\n\nThus, cortical control of the motor behaviors used to infer cognition in neonates is not neurobiologically plausible.\n\n\nResearchers should be cautious when making claims about developmental continuity between newborn and adult cognition (i.e., ‘core knowledge’) and its supporting neural architecture.\n\n(Blumberg & Adolph, 2023)\n\n\n\n(Figure 1 from Blumberg & Adolph, 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Figure I from Blumberg & Adolph, 2023).

New neurons are indicated in green. (A) Neuroblasts that are generated in the subventricular zone lining the lateral ventricle (LV) in rodents migrate to the OB, a structure crucial for olfaction, where they integrate as interneurons. (B) Neuroblasts are present in the subventricular zone also in humans, and new neurons integrate in the adjacent striatum, which plays an essential role in movement coordination, procedural learning, and memory, as well as motivational and emotional control. New neurons are continuously generated in the DG of the hippocampus—a brain structure essential for memory and mood control—in both rodents and humans (A, B). A limited subpopulation of DG neurons are subject to exchange in rodents (C), whereas the majority turn over in humans (D) [4–6]. The neurons within the turning over population are continuously exchanged. A value of 100% on the y-axis means that all neurons have been replaced since the individual’s birth.\n(Baumann & Pham-Dinh, 2001)\n(Huttenlocher, 2009)"

However, many diseases manifest with clear evidence of physiological and network abnormality in the absence of anatomical changes, raising the question of whether organoids possess sufficient neural network complexity to model these conditions. Here, we explore the network-level functions of brain organoids using calcium sensor imaging and extracellular recording approaches that together reveal the existence of complex network dynamics reminiscent of intact brain preparations. We demonstrate highly abnormal and epileptiform-like activity in organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from individuals with Rett syndrome, accompanied by transcriptomic differences revealed by single-cell analyses. We also rescue key physiological activities with an unconventional neuroregulatory drug, pifithrin-α. Together, these findings provide an essential foundation for the utilization of brain organoids to study intact and disordered human brain network formation and illustrate their utility in therapeutic discovery.\n(Samarasinghe et al., 2021)\n\n\n\n\n(Figure 2 from Samarasinghe et al., 2021). a, Schematic illustrating the identification of active neurons by virtue of their Ca2+ transients (I), representation of their network organization (II) and methods used to collect extracellular recordings (III). b, Example of live two-photon microscopy imaging of an H9 hESC-derived fusion organoid demonstrating acquisition of regions of interest (red circles) and the resulting activity profile shown as normalized ΔF/F values, where each line is an individual neuron (middle) and representation of the same data as a colorized amplitude plot (right). c, Addition of 100 μM BMI had a minimal effect on Cx + Cx fusions (top) yet elicited spontaneous synchronization of neural activities in Cx + GE organoids (bottom). d, These synchronizations can be transformed into a normalized amplitude-versus-time plot for quantitative analyses (left) and further visualized as a clustergram following hierarchical clustering of calcium spiking data (right). e, Pooled data of the amplitude measurements.

Figure 1: General scheme of brain acute-stress regulatory pathways. Stressors activate brainstem and/or forebrain limbic structures. The brainstem can generate rapid hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses through direct projections to hypophysiotrophic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) or to preganglionic autonomic neurons (stress response triggers). By contrast, forebrain limbic regions have no direct connections with the HPA axis or the ANS and thus require intervening synapses before they can access autonomic or neuroendocrine neurons (top-down regulation). A high proportion of these intervening neurons are located in hypothalamic nuclei that are also responsive to homeostatic status, providing a mechanism by which the descending limbic information can be modulated according to the physiological status of the animal (‘middle management’).

FIGURE 1. Effector systems of the stress response. A stressor elicits rapid activation of the autonomic nervous system with its sympathoneuronal (SN) and sympatho-adrenomedullary (SAM) limbs releasing their main effectors, noradrenaline and adrenaline, respectively. Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis results in synthesis and release of its main effector, cortisol or corticosterone, in rodents.

Figure 3: The brain circuitry that regulates HPA axis stress responses. Stress-induced activation of the dorsal part of the medial parvocellular paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVNmpd) originates in several brain regions (excitatory inputs are coloured blue with solid lines and inhibitory (GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-ergic) inputs are coloured red with dashed lines). The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) receives direct noradrenergic, adrenergic and peptidergic innervation from the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). The dorsomedial components of the dorsomedial hypothalamus (dmDMH) and the arcuate nucleus (Arc) provide intrahypothalamic stress excitation. The anterior part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), particularly the anteroventral nucleus of the BST (avBST), activates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis stress responses. The PVN also receives a stress-excitatory drive from the dorsal raphe, the tuberomammillary nucleus, the supramammillary nucleus and the spinal cord, among others (omitted in the interest of space). Activation of the PVNmpd is inhibited by numerous hypothalamic circuits, including the medial preoptic area (mPOA), the ventrolateral component of the dorsomedial hypothalamus (vlDMH) and local neurons in the peri-PVN region (pPVN), encompassing the PVN surround and the subparaventricular zone. The posterior subregions of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (pBST) provide a prominent forebrain inhibition of HPA axis responses; most of these inputs are GABAergic.

Figure 2. Interoceptive Information and Its Integration with Emotional, Cognitive, and Motivational Signals from an Array of Cortical and Subcortical Regions. Interoceptive information of constantly changing body states arrives in the posterior insula by ascending sensory inputs from dedicated spinal and brainstem pathways via specific thalamic relays. This information is projected rostrally onto the anterior insula, where it is integrated with emotional, cognitive, and motivational signals from an array of cortical and subcortical regions. As a result, the anterior insula supports unique subjective feeling states. The anterior insula regulates the introduction of subjective feelings into cognitive and motivational processes by virtue of its cortical location at the cross-roads of numerous pathways involved in higher cognition and motivation.
